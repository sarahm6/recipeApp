Full Stack MERN App: Yasmeen's Kitchen


Introduction: My final project for the Per Scholas Software Engineering Program is a full-stack CRUD recipe application.

Projects Details:
For this project, you will be making another full CRUD app using the technologies outlined below.

- A working full-stack application, built by you, using the MERN stack: Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express and React.
- At least one model with full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete routes).
- Include at least one of the following features:

        - Pull from a third party API - either client side with AJAX or server-side with an NPM

            - NPMs that work with an API: Twitter, Yelp, etc. Remember the Axios module can make API calls server side to any URL.
        - Have two models 
        - Use a CSS framework like Skeleton Links to an external site, Bootstrap Links to an external site, BulmaLinks to an external site., or mui
        - auth (JWT, Passport, etc.)
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Render.
- Use react-router-dom
- The project must include a README.md file

## Technologies Used

**MERN Stack:** MongoDB, Express, React, Node

**Additional Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Tasty API

Future Enhancements:
- Work on the CSS to allow for a more aesthetic website
- Use bcrypt to allow users to login with encrypted passwords
- Add more recipes and allow users to keep a list of favorite recipes

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
